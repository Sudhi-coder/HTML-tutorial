Hii I am Sudhiksha Venkatachalapathy.I had Started with basics of html.HTML Stands for HyperText Markup Language.HyperText connects to another link or page.Markup contains a set of symbols or tags to display the structure ,format and presentation of digital documents.

CSS:
    I Think so we all heard about 
about CSS Cascading Style Sheet.This CSS helps to style the code in HTML.For eg it add color,font style,containers,and make more attractive.
    For eg:
    <h1>
    {
        color:red;
    }
    </h1>
Now the content of h1 will be displayed in red color due to CSS code.

JS:
    JS Stands for Java Script.This makes the better and more interactive.For eg buttons can be added while clicking on it some changes to be happen.
       For eg:onclick() function is used onclicking the tag or button it make some changes or something else.
    Button tag:<button>click me</button>.
click me button will be activated.
